# ML/DL_projects
Various mini projects in the machine and deep learning fields using python. 
All the projects will be uploaded with jupyter notebook and a full explanation of the code.

## Project #1: Benign or Malignant tumor
In this project I built a machine learning model using SVM algorithm with a polynomial kernel for the prevention of underfitting a data with multi dimensional 
features that can not be represented in a linear way.
* First after downloading the dataset to our local machine we saparate the dataset to 2 different pandas dataframe for features and lables
