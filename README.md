# ML/DL_projects
Various mini projects in the machine and deep learning fields using python. 
All the projects will be uploaded with jupyter notebook or Google Colab notebook 

## Project #1: Detection of Covid19 patients using chest X-ray (Tensorflow and keras libraries)
In this project I used Google Colab notebook for its ease of use and beacuse I dont own an Nvidia GPU (Tensorflow supports only Nvidia GPUs)
## Project #2: Benign or Malignant tumor (with sklearn library)
In this project I built a machine learning model using SVM algorithm with a polynomial kernel for the prevention of underfitting a data with multi dimensional 
features that can not be represented in a linear way.
* First after downloading the dataset to our local machine we saparate the dataset to 2 different pandas dataframe for features and labels. 
* Second we visualize our features and preprocessed our data and end up with numpy array of features and labels as well as 0.2 ratio of test and train data.
* Third we built our model using SVC with polynomial kernel and trained our model on the training data and tested it on the test data.
